    "#Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In the context of programming, a method is a function that is defined within a class or an object. It is a callable behavior \n",
    "   or action that an object of a particular class can perform. Methods are associated with objects and are used to manipulate\n",
    "   the data and interact with other objects in an object-oriented programming paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here are some key differences between a method and a regular function:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    1. Scope: Methods are defined within a class or an object, and their scope is limited to that class or object. They have \n",
    "       access to the data (attributes) and other methods of the class. On the other hand, regular functions are standalone \n",
    "       entities with a global or local scope, and they do not have direct access to the attributes or methods of a class\n",
    "       unless passed as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Object Dependency: Methods are typically designed to operate on specific objects or instances of a class. They often\n",
    "       require an object as the first parameter, commonly referred to as self (in Python) or this (in other languages). This\n",
    "       allows the method to access and modify the object's attributes and perform actions specific to that object. Regular\n",
    "       functions, on the other hand, do not have an inherent object dependency unless explicitly passed as arguments.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    3. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Methods can be inherited by subclasses from their parent classes, allowing for code reuse\n",

    "       methods. Regular functions are not associated with a particular class hierarchy, so they do not have the concept of \n",
    "       inheritance or polymorphism.\n",
